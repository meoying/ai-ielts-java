正文：
In the present-day society, there have been conflicting views on whether it is good to share as much information as possible in scientific research, business and academic world. Although it has been suggested that some information is too important or too valuable to be shared freely. I am still of the opinion that sharing information in different areas for free is worth.

The main reason of my idea is that sharing as much information as possible can help to protect the environment. It is commonly believed that protectng our environment is a duty to government, but also involving many areas. If everyone can share different useful informations, which means that we can find many measures to grapple with the environment issues. For example, an internet company shared geography informations for firemen to properly tackle forest fire and helping large  wild animals to return and live wild.

Others, however, may tend to believe that there is no free lunch. This is because following the money trail is always a golden route. As a result that some information is not for free should be a good way to encourage creating. Take my friend peter as an example. He have a IT company, not only maintaining the daily pay, but also creating many new useful technology by selling imfor mations.

Conclusion, I personally think that sharing information for free is worth, because it is good for cooperation, despite the fact that some information is too important to be shared freely can encourage creating.
